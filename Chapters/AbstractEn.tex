\AbstractEn{
  Large-scale linguistic models (مدل های زبانی بزرگ) are models that are trained using deep learning techniques on large textual data and are capable of producing human-like text and performing various tasks based on the input provided. These models can be used to generate creative content, translate languages, answer questions and perform other tasks. But the implementation of these models in real environments faces challenges such as the need for large computing resources, data privacy and security, and ethical responsibility. In this paper, we present a method for using containers to run مدل های زبانی بزرگ quickly and locally. Containers provide the possibility to create and run independent and portable software environments. We show how to use containers to run language models on local machines without the need for a cloud service. We review the advantages and challenges of this method and show several practical cases. We present the results of our experiments on several well-known language models and several linguistic tasks, and show that this method can maintain high efficiency and accuracy. We also suggest several directions for future work in this area.
